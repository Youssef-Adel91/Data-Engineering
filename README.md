This repository contains my solution for the Thndr Data Engineering Architecture Assignment, completed as part of the DEPI – Microsoft Data Engineering Track.
The assignment focuses on analyzing how Thndr—a leading FinTech investment platform—can structure its end-to-end data ecosystem using modern data engineering practices.

🚀 Overview
The goal of this assignment is to design a scalable, secure, real-time data architecture that supports:
User onboarding & KYC
Market data ingestion
Trading & transaction processing
Portfolio calculations
Compliance & auditing
App analytics and user behavior tracking
The solution includes a full breakdown of:
✔ Data Sources
✔ Storage Layers
✔ Processing Pipelines
✔ Serving Outputs
✔ Architecture Diagram

🧩 Architecture Components
1️⃣ Data Sources

KYC & onboarding data
Market data (real-time stock prices, order book)
Transactional trading data
App behavioral events
Support & compliance logs

2️⃣ Storage Layer

Data Lake – Raw logs, JSON streams, documents, clickstream
Data Warehouse – Cleaned transactions, portfolios, KPIs, analytics tables

3️⃣ Processing Layer

Real-Time Processing: live market ingestion, instant updates, fraud detection
Batch Processing: daily valuation, reconciliation, regulatory reporting
ETL/ELT Pipelines: cleaning, transformation, normalization

4️⃣ Serving Layer

BI dashboards (KPIs, trading metrics)
Machine learning models (fraud detection, recommendation)
Real-time APIs powering the mobile app
Compliance & audit reports

🎯 Key Learning Points

From this assignment, I practiced:
Thinking like a Data Engineer
Designing pipelines for FinTech environments
Combining batch + streaming systems
Understanding data lakes vs warehouses
Ensuring compliance-ready data flows
-Turning real business processes into scalable architecture
